Suturing
The are in the following format: 
Name, <t at goin in the i'th suture>, <time at coming out of i'th suture>,....
There are 4 sutures in total

Notes
Surgeon 'G' and "I' are rather novices, (G is very bad one). They fail often. 
It may be a good example to show return to last known good state and restart 
strategy sued by humans in general
G001 -very bad example, temporally elongated. may be leave out in training.
G003 also a bad example

Kinematics data: Suturing_H002.txt.corrupt (leave it out)

1. perhaps use the relative time taken for suture to go in and come out 
instead of absolute times! (similaly with positions.)

2. I think we might need some transformation of the data to allow temporal 
variations. They seem to vary a lot between users and even between trails 
of same users. (Ex. G001, G002). But one thing that is consistent is based 
on the skill the time taken for a user to push in the needle and pull it out. 

3. Videos G and F series are of smaller res. so the features need proper 
scaling
